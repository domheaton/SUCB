              <p>SUCB holds at least two annual concerts along with several smaller performances spaced throughout the year. The first major concert is our Christmas Concert in early December, with our second being the Spring Concert after the Easter holidays. Several other concerts are often organised throughout the year along with busking sessions in both Southampton and Winchester being organised annually.<br><br>Each of our concerts has a theme, be it film music or music to celebrate an anniversary. Our concerts are open to all ages and are always a fantastic way to spend an evening as we take you through the music we love to play.</p>

          <div><p>We employ two professional conductors to lead our band. Tim and Kevin run our rehearsals every Tuesday evening, guiding us through the various genres of music we play.

              <p>Tim began learning the violin at the age of 7 and went on to play with many ensembles in his home county including the Lincolnshire county orchestra. He joined the Royal Marines Band Service at the age of 16 and has been a professional musician now for some 27 years.<br><br>Whilst under training he studied violin under Professor Eric Sokell and saxophone under Adrian Brett and Derrick Holder. More recently he studied conducting with Malcolm Binney and Mark Heron.

              <p>Kevin played piano from the age of six, before discovering aged thirteen that the trombone much better suited his personality. After developing an interest in conducting while still at school, Kevin moved to Southampton in 2010 to study for a degree in music, during which time he became assistant conductor of both university orchestras and was appointed as one of Southampton University Concert Band’s musical directors.<br><br>Kevin completed his Masters in conducting at University of Southampton in 2015, and currently works as a teacher and conductor for Southampton Music Services. Kevin currently conducts Southampton Youth Wind Band and Southampton Youth Sinfonia, as well as running several younger training ensembles and working at Southampton Youth Orchestra as assistant director. More recently, Kevin has been in demand as a guest and deputy conductor at City of Southampton Orchestra, Downton Brass, Worthing Philharmonic Orchestra and London Gay Symphony Orchestra.<br><br>In the rare moments of peace when Kevin is not conducting, rehearsing or teaching, he likes to relax with a glass of cold ale in front of the snooker.</p>

              <p>Some of our band were lucky enough to spend 5 days touring the Netherlands. We played three concerts at The British School of Amsterdam, ZIMIHC Theatre and the Dr Sarphatihuis Retirement Home. <br><br>The band was conducted by our assistant conductors; Declan Flannery and Sophie Blundell alongside James Atkins - former assistant conductor. <br><br>Whilst we were there we went on a boat tour through the Amsterdam Canals, visited the Heineken Experience and ran through Utercht on our annual scavenger hunt. As with all our tours we celebrated our 'Repertoire Night' by dressing in costumes related to the pieces we have played that year and heading out into the city on a pub crawl. <br><br>It was a great experience for all involved and are looking forward to our next Tour.</p>
