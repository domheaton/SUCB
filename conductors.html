				<p>We employ two professional conductors to lead our band. Tim and Kevin run our rehearsals every Tuesday evening, guiding us through the various genres of music we play. As an unauditioned band, the professional conductors are able to help improve us as musicians. Below are profiles of our conductors.</p>

								<h2>Kevin Withell</h2>
								<p>Kevin played piano from the age of six, before discovering aged thirteen that the trombone much better suited his personality. After developing an interest in conducting while still at school, Kevin moved to Southampton in 2010 to study for a degree in music, during which time he became assistant conductor of both university orchestras and was appointed as one of Southampton University Concert Bandâ€™s musical directors.<br><br>Kevin completed his Masters in conducting at University of Southampton in 2015, and currently works as a teacher and conductor for Southampton Music Services. Kevin currently conducts Southampton Youth Wind Band and Southampton Youth Sinfonia, as well as running several younger training ensembles and working at Southampton Youth Orchestra as assistant director. More recently, Kevin has been in demand as a guest and deputy conductor at City of Southampton Orchestra, Downton Brass, Worthing Philharmonic Orchestra and London Gay Symphony Orchestra.<br><br>In the rare moments of peace when Kevin is not conducting, rehearsing or teaching, he likes to relax with a glass of cold ale in front of the snooker.</p>
